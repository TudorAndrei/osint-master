# OSINT Master

OSINT Master is an investigation platform for ingesting structured intelligence data and exploring relationships across entities in a graph-first workflow.

## What the platform does

- Creates isolated investigation workspaces.
- Ingests FTM-compatible datasets into an investigation graph.
- Lets analysts inspect, expand, and correlate entities and links.
- Supports enrichment workflows and notebook-style analysis context.

## Core principles

1. **FTM-first modeling** for compatibility with OpenAleph and Yente style ecosystems.
2. **Graph-native exploration** backed by FalkorDB.
3. **Practical analyst workflow** with search, context expansion, and notes.
